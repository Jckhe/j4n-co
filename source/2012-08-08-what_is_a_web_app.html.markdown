subtitle: The difference between a 'web page' and a 'webapp'

summary: If you've ever spent any time browsing through tech blogs or know someone that does, it's likely that they've mentioned the word 'webapp' before. What's a webapp you ask? let's find out.

There was a time when the internet was a much simpler place. When you could explain to someone what a web page was in a single sentence. But that time is not now. We do so much online that that the term 'web page' really only applies only to a small number of the sites we visit on a daily basis. So, before we get to explaining webapps, we should clarify what a web page is. The one sentence answer is: **It's an html file**. 

The slightly longer answer is that in the olden days, you could (and still can) create a website by opening up a text-editor and creating an html file. Then, you would upload the file to a server and voila, you're riding the information super-highway. If you wanted to change your website, you would go in and edit this file. If you wanted to add more pages to your site, then you would go in and add more files, just like you would add pages to a book.  As you can see, this web 'page' analogy was spot on in this context.

Then things got complicated. You began to be able to 'do' stuff on the internet. This is pretty much where the 'page' analogy breaks down. You don't really 'do' stuff to a book right? You *read* it, your brain absorbs it, end of story. But do you just *read* your email? Facebook? no. You reply to it and post stuff. That's the one sentence explanation of a webapp. **It's a website where you do stuff**, like log-in and keep a profile or an account or upload photos. 

'Doing' stuff on a website is much more complicated than just a bunch of html files. It requires software. The 'app' (i.e application, i.e. software) part of 'webapp' refers to exactly that: the software that makes the web pages (as for the web part, that's the internet). With a webapp, you can make changes to one thing on your site, and if need be, the webapp applies those changes to the rest of your site automatically. 

Most sites on the internet these days are powered by webapps. Take the blogging engine [wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) for example. Wordpress is a webapp. When you create a blog in wordpress, you can change the theme of your blog and wordpress will apply that theme to every single page of your blog, automatically. Most other sites you visit are also webapps - facebook, gmail, twitter,  pinterest are all webapps. Sometime handling hundreds of millions of requests and generating hundreds of millions of pages per day... webapps are very busy robots indeed.
