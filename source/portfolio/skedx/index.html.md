**WHAT IT IS -** Skedx is an web-based staff scheduling tool for the retail/hospitality industry. It lets managers manage all aspects of staff scheduling, including things like: 
- managing employee vacations 
- employee time-clocking
- managing daily employee availability
- budgeting 
- reporting 

Employees on the other hand can check their weekly schedules, book vacations, receive SMS alerts, and communicate with other staff members, all from the comfort of a web-browser.   

**WHAT I DID -** Interface design & front-end development. Skedx is a Ruby on Rails application. I worked on designing the interface, then I implemented it in CSS/HTML/JS. I also made the website, [skedx.com](http://skedx.com).
