I just downloaded Google Drive today. I know I'm a little late to the party, but I thought that maybe having my Google Documents on my computer would motivate me to write more. 

Well, it turns out, Google Drive is not about having your Google Documents on your computer at all. Instead of true document syncing a la dropbox, Google decided that it would be enough to sync bookmarks to your Google Documents.

The .gdoc, gsheet files are just urls pointing to the file on the internet, which basically means that you can only edit them with Google Drive in your web browser, which also means you can forget about offline editing.
