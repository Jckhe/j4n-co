I'm not much of a writer (yet) so when it came time to write this first post, I did what any self respecting hacker would. I googled it. To be sure, there's no shortage of tips and tricks, advice, how-to's and simple steps. 

Most posts offer advice like [start with a mission statement](http://www.fuelyourblogging.com/what-to-write-for-your-very-first-blog-post/), some even instruct you on the slightly creepy approach of [conducting keyword research](http://www.incomediary.com/step-by-step-guide-writing-blog-post) before you start writing, because nothing could be more important than achieving that [optimal keyword density](http://www.seo.com/blog/keyword-density-frequency-prominence-proximity/), right?


After looking through what google had to offer on this topic, I came to the only logical conclusion that anyone would: *That some things in life you just can't google*, and those are the important things, the things you just have to figure out for yourself.

So I invite you to join me in this little experiment. I'm probably going to be write about web-related things, some from a bird's-eye view, some from a worm's-eye view, some designy things, or maybe bicycles things. We'll figure it out as we go along.
