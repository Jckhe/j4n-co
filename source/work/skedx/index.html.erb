<strong>Employee scheduling made easy.</strong> 
<p class="first_paragraph">
Remember your first job? At that clothing shop or restaurant? 
</p>
<p  class="first_paragraph">
Remember how <em>'the schedule'</em> always felt like the center of your existance? 
Remember how people would constantly be posting changes, trading shifts, or calling in to ask when they're working? 
</p> 
<p  class="first_paragraph">
	Skedx make all that chaos go away. It's an online system that integrates vacation management, scheduling, time-clocking, alerts... and it was my job to make all of that <em>easy</em>.

	<dt>WHAT IT IS</dt>
	<dd>	
 		Skedx is an web-based staff scheduling tool for retail/hospitality. It lets managers manage all aspects of staff scheduling, including: 
		<ul>		
			<li>employee vacations </li>
			<li>time + attendance</li>
			<li>daily employee availability</li>
			<li>budgeting</li> 
			<li>reporting </li>
		</ul>
		For employees on the other hand, skedx provides alerts for schedule updates, vacation requests, shift-swapping etc. all from the comfort of a web-browser.

		I designed all aspects of the interface, then I turned it into reality.  
    I also designed and built the marketing website: <a href="http://skedx.com">skedx.com</a>.
