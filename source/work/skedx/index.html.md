	<dt>WHAT IT IS</dt>
	<dd>	
 		Skedx is an web-based staff scheduling tool for retail/hospitality. It lets managers manage all aspects of staff scheduling, including: 
		<ul>		
			<li>employee vacations </li>
			<li>time + attendance</li>
			<li>daily employee availability</li>
			<li>budgeting</li> 
			<li>reporting </li>
		</ul>
		For employees on the other hand, skedx provides alerts for schedule updates, vacation requests, shift-swapping etc. all from the comfort of a web-browser.

	<dt>WHAT I DID</dt>
	<dd>
		Interface design + front-end development. Skedx is a Ruby on Rails application. I worked on designing the interface, then I implemented it in <dfn title="This is the stuff the internet is made of.">CSS/HTML/JS</dfn>. I also made the website, <a href="http://skedx.com">skedx.com</a>.
